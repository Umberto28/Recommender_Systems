# Recommender Systems
Repository of assignments from the part on Recommender Systems of the University course "Advanced Topics in Computer Science"

> [!NOTE]
> This project is developed in python 3.12 and use Pandas, NumPy and ScikitLearn libraries.

### Assignment 1
Implement a user-based collaborative filtering approach, in order to create a simple solution of recommender system. <br />
- **Used Similarity functions**: Pearson correlation, Custom cosine similarity <br />
- **Used Prediction function**: Common prediction function <br />

### Assignment 2
Implement existing approaches for producing group recommendations and propose some ideas about group aggregation and implement them for the same topic.
- **Used Aggregation functions**: Avarage, Least Misery, [Upward Leveling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417307108?fr=RR-2&ref=pdf_download&rr=86dae1893b7a77ff) <br />

### Assignment 3
Implement existing approaches for producing sequential group recommendations proposing some ideas and implement them for the same topic.
- **Used Similarity functions**: Custom cosine similarity, [Pncr-Adf similarity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335988033_A_new_Similarity_Measure_for_Collaborative_Filtering_based_Recommender_Systems#full-text) <br />
- **Used Prediction function**: Common prediction function <br />
- **Used Aggregation function**: [Upward Leveling Aggregation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417307108?fr=RR-2&ref=pdf_download&rr=86dae1893b7a77ff) <br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to perform all the assignments, you have to execute the corresponding py file (ass1 -> user_recom; ass2 -> group_recom; ass3 -> sequential_recom).
